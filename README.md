# ***Solar***
Work in progress roblox ui lib lightly based on the windows 95 / 98 ui but with a modern touch

literally anything that is visual can be customized.

![Preview](https://github.com/EbicSeal/Solar/blob/main/Naamloos.png)

Completed: 70%

Known issues:
- Arrays missing support for values and drop down widgets
- Scrolling sucking utter ass because it uses the roblox default scrollable frames


Do **not** make an issue when:
- Your not using the library correctly / Using widget functions only made for internal use
- Using a modified library
- its about a style (unless its the default style that comes in `Example.lua`)
- not using a style

failing to meet these demands may result in your issue being ignored.
