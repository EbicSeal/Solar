# ***Solar***
Work in progress roblox ui lib lightly based on the windows 95 / 98 ui but with a modern touch

literally anything that is visual can be customized.

![Preview](https://github.com/EbicSeal/Solar/blob/main/banner.png)

## Module
Version: `b0.7.4`

Completed: 60%

State: `Unfinished` `Usable`

## Planned features:
- Built in minimal style to atleast fix positional issues and make the base ui usable without a style
- Easier way to add widgets / addon support outside of the module
- Support for style animations (like drop downs smoothing out instead of just doing it instantly)
- More style modifiers like drop shadows and easier gradient use
- Easier widget positioning instead of just being locked to left and right
- Window Top Buttons (not tabs, buttons, kinda like the standard `file` `view` `help` ect
- Custom windows (custom ui in a window)
- Window specific styles
- Bug fixes ofc
- Custom gui rendering (my own gui handler, roblox's version is so limiting..)

Expect these features to be added over time, it may take a very long while to do so

## Planned widgets:
- Color picker (in 2 types)
- Sliders (horizontal and vertical)
- Sub Windows (Windows in Windows)
- Trees

## Known issues:
- Scrolling sucking utter ass because it uses the roblox default scrollable frames


## Do **not** make an issue when:
- Your not using the library correctly / Using widget functions only made for internal use
- Using a modified library
- Its about a style (unless its the default style that comes in releases)
- Not using a style

failing to meet these demands may result in your issue being ignored.
